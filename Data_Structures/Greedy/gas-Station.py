'''
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2..
Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.
