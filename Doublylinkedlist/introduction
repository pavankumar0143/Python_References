-->Doubly linked list contains extra pointer called previous pointer together with the next pointer and data which are there in a singly linked list.
-->Advantage of doubly linked list over singly linked list
    -A DLL can traverse in both forward and reverse direction.
    -Delete operation in DLL is more efficient than singly linked list
-->Disadvantage of doubly linked list over singly linked list
    -Every node of DLL require extra space for an previous pointer.
    -All operations require extra pointer to be maintained.
